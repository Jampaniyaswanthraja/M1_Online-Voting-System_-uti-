# Identifying features
* The multifaceted online e-voting system. The proposed system is capable of handling electronic ballots with multiple scopes at the same time,e.g., presidential, municipal, parliamentary, amongst others.The system caters for integrity of an election process in termsof the functional and non-functional requirements.The functional requirements embedded in the design of the proposed system warrant well-secured identification and authentication processes for the voter through the use of combined simple biometrics.
# State of art/ Research
* The design of the system guarantees that no votes in favor of agiven candidate are lost, due to improper tallying of the voting counts, with the proper incorporation of system FLAGâ€™s. Transparency of voting follows through in all phases of an election process to assure the voter that his/her vote went in favor of his/her candidate of choice. Of utmost importance are the requirements forcorrectness, robustness, coherence, consistency, and security.
# Requirements
# High Level Requirements
* Features of my project
* The incorporation of biometric technologies can be as simple as using a single biometric. However, a single biometric measure is always subject to security breaches, if not properly attended and administered. This naturally includes security passwords, fingerprints, and signatures, all of which can be spoofed when applied in a non properly attended environment. This is significantly alleviated and system security enhanced with the proper application of combined simple biometric measures.
# Low Level Requirements
* How each feature is implemented
* The application of combined weak biometrics leads to systems that are less complex and more robust in terms of the security levels attained. There are strong single biometric measures which involve retinal and iris scans that are rather hard, if not impossible, to breach, but usually lead to more complex systems which, in turn, slow down the underlying biometric matching process due to the amount of data processing involved. For these reasons, amongst others, the type of biometrics addressed in this work is of the former type that involves combined biometrics of the weak types. This will be elaborated upon in the succeeding sections

# Swot Analysis
* STRENGTHS
* Mobile voting as an aspect of electronic voting cannot be separated from electronic voting. It is an inclusion to electronic voting platform to support mobile devices in voting.
* WEAKNESSES
* The weakness to the integration and total deployment of mobile technology in voting begins from awareness, policy and technology. 
* OPPORTUNITIES
* Both supporters and opponents of e-voting offer arguments justifying which method is better suited for the electoral process. 
# 4W'S and 1-H
* What- voter can use hisher voting right online without any difficulty. 
* why- While the main perceived benefit to online voting is increasing voter participation.
* where- voters will be able to instantly access the voting system online.
* when- in elections.
* How-To register to vote, voters are added to an electoral roll of eligible voters, as with any election.
# Best method followed
* Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
* Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty
